teaching students to take ideas from the conceptual stage all the way through to commercialization Parallel to his work in hydrogen energy and education Billings was also an innovator in the computer field When the microprocessor chip came out in the early s Billings jumped on the opportunity and developed his own microcomputer line one of the first and with the Billings Computer System founded the Billings Computer Corporation In the early days of his work in the computer field Billings made a break-through design for a computer networking system which he patented and which came to be known as client/server computing the system now adopted worldwide becoming the predominant method for networking computers More recently Billings established a computer networking company WideBand Corporation to launch his high-speed networking design called WideBand The new Gigabit Ethernet standards are partially based on innovations and concepts he developed and patented in the early s as part of his WideBand Networking technology As the next step he developed products with the capability of operating Ethernet at gigabit data rates over conventional LAN cable WideBand customers now enjoy the performance benefits of Gigabit Ethernet without the expense of rewiring their premises WideBand Corporation became a public company in and is today noted for the distinctive design enhanced features and U.S.-based manufacture of high-speed networking products When the current education crisis in America first came to light in the late s with the reports that America's children were coming up in last place among developing nations in subjects like math and science Billings turned his creative attention again to the education field with the determination to fight back by moving ahead through technology By studying the science of learning and incorporating an interactive feedback system into the process he designed a powerful computer-based learning tool which he named Acellus Acellus integrates time-proven methods of teaching with the latest advancements in technology Using video lectures prepared by the best educators in America the system delves into each topic to the necessary level for the student to understand and be able to move on The system's sophisticated feedback capability makes it possible for creators of the coursework to analyze where students are having problems and to make adjustments which can be implemented immediately into Acellus systems at remote locations and students can see the changes as soon as the next day Schools throughout the country are now using Acellus Today Billings is once again working on his first dream incorporating into practical everyday life the widespread use of renewable clean hydrogen energy Now with the billion hydrogen fuel cell development plan of President Bush in America and the billion Euro hydrogen development plan recently announced by the European community the time has come to make this aspiration a reality This is a day I have dreamed of for a long time acknowledged Billings at the re-establishing of his old company Billings Energy Corporation I have long known the benefits of a hydrogen energy system and at last I think I am going to live to see it come about Of course I aim to be right in the middle of it making it happen Billings has been at this point before and knows better than most the real cost of the dream in time and in dollars But now more than ever he also knows that he was right years ago as head of the first Billings Energy Corporation when he warned that if we did not change our energy policy not only would we severely perhaps irreparably impact the environment someday we would pay for foreign oil with American blood Billings is now in the process of raising million from private investors to launch his new initiative Roger Billings and his hydrogen dream are featured in the July issue of Time Magazine and will be the subject of John Gibson's The

cited Vetronix's year history of developing hand-held diagnostic equipment as giving the company a unique ability to read and process the serial data produced by vehicle on-board computer systems The study was prepared by Frank Viquez Director of Automotive Electronics for Allied Business Intelligence The study noted that only a handful of players have the ability to access vehicle sensing and diagnostic modules and to decipher diagnostic trouble codes DTCs While many companies have the ability to read and process standard OBD II trouble codes much of the data needed for advanced diagnostics is processed in non-standard formats that vary from manufacturer to manufacturer and even between models from the same manufacturer The ability to access data and trouble codes that will not illuminate the Check Engine light yet are critical to proper vehicle functions is cited as a key differentiator amongst commercial telematics suppliers Vetronix with its nearly years of experience in working with these data streams has gained an advantage in developing RVDS in its telematics products Frank Viquez the author of the study noted Vetronix introduced one of the world's first handheld diagnostic tools in the late s Since then they have worked with most of the major vehicle manufacturers and continuously built their knowledge of how to diagnose problems across a wide

       " \"Savi Technology and MIT's Auto ID Center Collaborate in Bringing Product Identification Standard to July Business c Business Savi Technology and MIT's Auto ID Center Collaborate in Bringing Product Identification Standard to Global Supply Chain Asset Management and Security SUNNYVALE Calif CAMBRIDGE Mass.-(BUSINESS WIRE)-July Enabling Total Supply Chain Visibility Through a Global Information and Security Network Where Automated Technologies Interoperate and Communicate Savi Technology a leading provider of real-time solutions for global supply chain security and asset management and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Auto-ID Center an industry-funded research program to advance automatic identification technology today announced that they will collaborate to include support of the Electronic Product Code EPC an emerging standard for identifying items in the supply chain in Savi's SmartChain platform and SmartChain suite of software applications including the Savi Transportation Security System and Savi Asset Management System The goal of this collaboration is to help bridge the gaps in supply chain visibility from the item level to the conveyance transporting them as well as end-to-end from the factory to final destination For example if the security of a container is breached the integrated solution could tell authorities in real-time what specific items are missing from a container as well as that the container had been tampered with or violated This will be achieved by ensuring that multiple automatic identification technologies including the Auto-ID Center's Electronic Product Code for passive Radio Frequency Identification RFID tags that help track items and Savi's active RFID tags for securing and managing supply chain assets can communicate with each other to create complete real-time end-to-end nested visibility of items ranging from individual products to the shipping cartons pallets containers and other conveyances that transport them to the transportation vehicle itself The EPC is an emerging standard developed by the Auto-ID Center for item-level identification and tracking throughout the supply chain A number of major retailers are sponsoring and supporting the EPC for item-level tracking and Wal-Mart NYSE:WMT the world's largest retailer recently announced that it will require its top suppliers to have EPC-compliant tags on pallets and cases by the year Savi Technology also is a long-time member and active participant in the Auto-ID Center Savi provides real-time solutions for securing and managing supply chain assets These solutions include active RFID tags with long read ranges and large data storage capabilities readers to capture the data and robust software to turn the data into actionable information Savi's real-time solutions have been successfully deployed to track conveyances over the past decade in the commercial and government sectors including containers with military supplies shipped by the U.S Department of Defense which operates the worlds largest RFID network and is credited for helping standardize the use of barcodes for item identification In the past year Savi's nested visibility capabilities have also been used to track and secure items being shipped in intermodal containers as part of the global Smart and Secure Tradelanes initiative which is the worlds largest supply chain security initiative driven by industry The collaboration also will encompass compatibility between RFID and other automatic identification technologies as well as the Auto-ID Center's Savant software platform and Savi's SmartChain platform and SmartChain suite of applications the Savi Transportation Security System and Savi Asset Management System Both organizations pointed out that there are times throughout the supply chain when EPC technologies for item-level visibility are applicable and other times when active RFID systems are appropriate Interoperability of these technologies will provide a greater breadth and depth of visibility for particular shipments and individual products within them As one example EPC-tagged products and pallets lose their visibility when placed inside metal containers for ocean truck rail or air transport unless there is a compatible active tag on the container Savi has been a leader in automatic identification technology for over a decade With their global experience it is no surprise that they are again taking a leadership role in addressing the critical concerns of global supply chain management and security said Kevin Ashton Executive Director of the Auto-ID Center at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology We worked with Savi closely in the successful field test of the Electronic Product Code and look forward to working with Savi to ensure that our technologies are complementary when total visibility is required in the supply chain whether it's item-level identification in a storage room or container-level visibility at an ocean port By ensuring that our solutions work side-by-side we hope to accelerate the adoption of these emerging standards and thereby broaden the context of their application to a global scale The vision of the Auto-ID Center has inspired dozens of companies to come together to define technologies and standards that will enable automatic identification technologies to realize their potential to change how the world does business said Blair LaCorte Executive Vice President of Savi Technology The Electronic Product Code has great potential to bring about a common means by which products are identified and information about those products made immediately available to concerned parties This will have a significant impact on our efforts to bring about a common standards-based security and information network for the supply chain Both organizations already have been actively engaged in helping to drive global standards for RFID and supply chain security applications On May the Uniform Code Council and EAN International announced the launch of AutoID Inc a not-for-profit organization that will oversee commercial and technical standards for EPC The AutoID Center will continue to provide the kind of groundbreaking research that has led to development of today's EPC Also in May the International Organization for Standardization ISO and Smart and Secure Tradelanes which relies on Savi's RFID and software solutions for its base infrastructure announced their partnership to help define development and implement global supply chain security standards To achieve total supply chain visibility and security worldwide it's critical to have a common sets of standards for seamless transitions between technologies processes and borders said Gen U.S Army Ret John Coburn chairman of the Strategic Council on Security Technology a global advisory resource that helped to launch Smart and Secure Tradelanes which is an industry-driven consortium of partners committed to the formation of an automated global security network It's clear that there are a number of leading companies organizations and standards bodies already working on these complex issues This new collaboration between two industry leaders Savi Technology and the Auto-ID Center will help accelerate this important process SST is being built on existing infrastructure and technologies developed for the U.S Department of Defense's Total Asset Visibility network a global infrastructure which most recently contributed to the success of the recent military operations in Iraq The technology and infrastructure used for SST is both proven and available for immediate deployment while remaining open and adaptable for the integration of new emerging technologies and standards such as the Electronic Product Code Many of the world's largest port operators carriers service providers and shippers are participating in SST The Smart and Secure Tradelanes initiative is closely coordinated with the U.S Customs Container Security Initiative CSI Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism C-TPAT and the U.S Department of Transportation's Transportation Security Administration's TSA maritime security initiatives such as Operation Safe Commerce OSC With the inclusion of EPC support in the Smart and Secure Tradelanes information infrastructure shippers logistics service providers and carriers will be able to fully automate the creation of an electronic manifest for each shipping container enabling them to more easily comply with new U.S Customs regulations that will soon require the submission of shipping manifests at least hours prior to the shipment leaving for the United States In addition importers Customs agents or other law enforcement agencies and service providers will be able to be able to quickly identify specific individual products for inspection and audit the shipment and transportation history of individual products in case of recall due to safety or health concerns Savi Technology has been a sponsor of the Auto-ID Center and member of the Technology Board of the

earnings per share were percent above with operating earnings per share of versus per share in Operating earnings for the second quarter of were million compared to million in For the first half of sales were billion percent higher than in Net income of million increased percent over last year and net income per share of rose percent above Excluding restructuring charges in both periods operating earnings in the first half of increased to million percent more than in and operating earnings per share of rose percent compared to last year Alexander M Cutler Eaton chairman and chief executive officer said We are very pleased with our second quarter results Our sales revenue of billion was the highest quarterly sales revenue since the second quarter of The sales growth in the second quarter of percent above last year consisted of percent from our four recent acquisitions and percent from higher exchange rates We continued to outperform our end markets as we estimate that our overall end markets declined percent compared to the second quarter last year We made good progress during the second quarter on integrating our four recent acquisitions The profits of the acquired businesses have thus far been modest as the real benefits from the restructuring activities will not be seen until the second half We continue to make progress in reducing their working capital and improving their performance and anticipate that working capital levels in the acquired businesses will be reduced significantly by the end of the year During the quarter we issued million shares generating net proceeds of million The proceeds have strengthened our balance sheet and will provide us with the flexibility to pursue growth opportunities that may arise in the near term For the second half we do not anticipate any significant growth in our end markets As a result for the year as a whole we expect our end markets to be flat to slightly down We anticipate full-year net income per share of to and third quarter net income per share of to said Cutler Excluding the restructuring charges to integrate our recent acquisitions we are maintaining our full-year operating earnings guidance of to per share We anticipate third quarter operating earnings per share will be in the to range We are pleased that in spite of end markets which are weaker than our expectations at the beginning of the year and the issuance of an additional million shares we are able to maintain our full-year earnings guidance As a result of our continued strong operating performance we have decided to increase our quarterly dividend to cents per share a percent increase over our current dividend said Cutler Business Segment Results Second quarter sales of Fluid Power Eaton's largest business segment posted an all-time quarterly record of million percent above one year earlier and excluding the impact of the Boston Weatherhead and Mechanical Products acquisitions up percent over the second quarter of This compares to a decline of percent in Fluid Power's markets with North American fluid power industry shipments down about percent commercial aerospace markets off percent and defense aerospace markets up by percent Operating profits in the second quarter were million Operating profits before restructuring charges were million up percent compared to a year earlier We do not anticipate a recovery in the traditional mobile and industrial hydraulics markets until next year The construction and agricultural equipment markets have shown little growth despite earlier expectations that they would post moderate growth in said Cutler The decline in the commercial aerospace market has occurred as we expected Military aerospace markets have been strong largely offsetting the decline in the commercial markets During the second quarter Eaton unveiled the world's first psi commercial aircraft hydraulic pump designed specifically for use on the new Airbus A This new higher pressure technology will provide commercial aircraft with more powerful hydraulic systems at lower weight In the Industrial Commercial Controls segment second quarter sales were million up percent from last year Excluding the impact of the Delta and Commonwealth Sprague Capacitor acquisitions in and the divestiture of the Navy Controls business last year second quarter sales were down percent compared to Operating profits in the second quarter were million Operating profits before restructuring charges were million down percent from results one year ago End markets for our electrical business remained weak during the second quarter with an estimated percent decline in the markets for this business compared to last year said Cutler We expect that the electrical distribution equipment market will not begin to recover until The residential market in North America has remained strong thus far in but the commercial markets particularly the office construction markets have weakened further The integration of the electrical division of Delta which we purchased at the end of January is proceeding slightly ahead of plan said Cutler The Delta acquisition reduced the margins for the Industrial and Commercial Controls segment compared to last year but we expect stronger profitability from the Delta business in the second half of this year as our restructuring programs gain additional traction The Automotive segment posted record second quarter sales of million which was percent above the comparable quarter last year NAFTA automotive production declined percent while European production was down percent compared to the same period last year Operating profits were million down percent from a year ago Our Automotive segment continued its strong revenue performance with sales that significantly outpaced its end markets said Cutler We also benefited during the quarter from the strong euro which added percent to our revenues for the quarter Our margins during the quarter were lower than last year principally as a result of new programs which have not yet ramped up to their mature production economics Last week Eaton announced a new licensing arrangement with Lotus Engineering to commercialize Lotus Active Valve Train technology Active Valve Train technology can be used to substantially reduce emissions and improve fuel economy The Truck segment posted sales of million in the second quarter up percent compared to last year and recorded operating profits of million a percent increase over operating profits NAFTA heavy-duty truck production was down percent and NAFTA medium-duty truck production was up percent European truck production was down percent and South American production was flat versus a year ago Second quarter production of NAFTA heavy-duty trucks totaled about units For the full year we continue to expect production of heavy-duty trucks in NAFTA to total approximately units said Cutler The new operating model we have put in place in our Truck business over the last two years is working well The model has enabled the business to adjust to the ramping up and down of volumes last year and to this year's ramping up of volumes without incurring the inefficiencies and expediting costs we incurred in previous periods of substantial volume change Eaton announced during the second quarter a contract to supply Federal Express with hybrid electric powertrains for delivery trucks Compared to the medium-duty trucks now in use these vehicles offer significantly lower emissions and also significantly increased fuel economy FedEx plans to verify the performance from the hybrid electric trucks prior to introducing this technology more broadly into its pick up and delivery fleet the timing of which could be as early as the fall of Eaton also announced during the quarter that it has been awarded a grant by the U.S Department of Energy to develop hybrid

       " \"J B Hunt Transport Services Inc Reports Record Revenues and Earnings for the Second Quarter of July Business c Business LOWELL Ark.-(BUSINESS WIRE)-July J B Hunt Transport Services Inc NASDAQ:JBHT announced second quarter net earnings of million or diluted earnings per share of cents compared with second quarter earnings of million or cents per diluted share Total operating revenue for the current quarter was million compared with million during the second quarter of During the second quarter of revenues of the Company's Truck segment fell while the Intermodal segment revenue rose over the comparable period of Dedicated segment DCS revenue increased during the current quarter Earnings improved significantly in the quarter as the operating ratios in each of our three operating segments showed substantial improvement As we have been saying now for a couple of years our Company has embraced the strategy of utilizing the three business segments as our basic service offering and achieving best-in-class customer service safety and profitability as our overall goals Given the success over the past quarters at improving the Truck operating ratio relative to the comparable period the obvious attainment of a new level of profitability in our Intermodal operations and the return to a more normalized profitability of our DCS group we are extremely pleased with the progress at delivering the profitability improvement we had anticipated and remain confident in our ability to achieve meaningful earnings growth and shareholder returns going forward stated Kirk Thompson President and Chief Executive Officer While the improvement is gratifying we are still short of our profitability goals of or better operating ratios in each of the segments We will continue to press on toward those goals The Truck operating ratio was for the quarter an basis point improvement vs the comparable period last year Revenue for the Truck segment declined to million from million as the truck fleet was reduced by approximately units vs the same quarter a year ago The improvement in the Truck business segment continues a trend of reaching the Company's stated objective of returning to acceptable margins Net revenue excluding fuel surcharges per tractor per day improved to or over the second quarter of in spite of a decline in miles per tractor Contributing to the decline in miles was the continuing slowness of the economy particularly after the Easter holiday Utilization of tractors as measured by miles per truck per day continued to be less than acceptable due to the lackluster economy However rate yields continued to improve as the loaded rate per mile excluding fuel surcharges increased relative to a year ago The end of June generated a spike in demand to the point that extra empty miles were incurred to provide needed capacity to some customers Thus the combination of sagging post-Easter demand and the increase in empty miles driven to reposition equipment to provide service to customers near the end of the quarter drove empty miles up slightly to vs for the second quarter a year ago even though we are paid for empty miles by some customers to meet their repositioning requests we continue to categorize those paid empty miles as empty in calculating the empty mile percentage The higher rates are a result of the Company's yield management initiatives and price increases implemented to address the higher costs affecting the truckload industry One of the significant cost increases that has plagued the trucking industry in recent months has been the spike in insurance and claims costs Reflecting the significant risk associated with operating a large fleet of trucks on America's congested highways our Truck segment incurred a increase in insurance and claims cost or approximately basis points on the operating ratio during the quarter relative to a year ago Contributing to the higher costs was an increase in insurance premiums and a number of costly accidents in April May and June were on the other hand exceptionally good months from a safety perspective We continue to put safe operations at the top of our priorities While the improvement in profitability is noteworthy the Company believes there is potential for further improvement Better returns in the Truck segment are a prerequisite for re-investment in the truckload business The Company has no plans to add capacity in the Truck segment until satisfactory margins are achieved The average number of trucks was for the second quarter of and for the second quarter of In the Intermodal segment the operating ratio was for the second quarter of a basis point improvement over the same quarter a year ago Intermodal revenue rose to million from million in the second quarter of Significant cost reductions in the area of both tractor and container maintenance contributed to the improved margin These cost reductions along with an improvement in utilization of the assets are a direct result of the replacement of of the container fleet in and a significant continuing investment in new tractors and containers in The combined capital outlay for the conversion of the container fleet to foot containers and the replacement of a substantial part of the dray fleet was approximately million over the two-year period Dray costs per load the pick-up and delivery portion of the intermodal move were down in the second quarter of vs a year ago positively impacting profitability As in the Truck segment yield management activity in Intermodal resulted in a more profitable freight mix by successfully de-emphasizing less profitable lanes Utilization of company containers as measured in turns per month reached record levels during the quarter and improved vs a year ago Intermodal demand was strong throughout the quarter Intermodal revenue per loaded mile excluding fuel surcharge was up when compared with the same period in The operating ratio for the DCS segment was the best in the last quarters at for the current quarter a basis point improvement over the same period a year ago Revenue per tractor per day increased While the truck fleet increased only DCS segment revenue rose to million in from million in and operating income was a record million in the current quarter Improved profits were driven by better asset utilization improved productivity and pricing expense controls and lower startup costs associated with new business vs a year ago DCS focus on asset utilization continued as idle capacity declined year-over-year loaded miles per load increased by backhaul volume increased by and empty mile percent declined by basis points Also benefiting productivity was an increase in revenue per backhaul load of Expense controls continue to be a key initiative for DCS A decrease in administrative headcount by resulted in leverage as evidenced by a improvement in the revenue per non-driver employee Likewise driver pay as a percent of net revenue excluding fuel surcharge declined by basis points year over year Maintenance costs declined basis points largely due to a reduction in age of tractor fleet These cost savings were partially offset by increased insurance and claims expense The average number of trucks was for the second quarter of vs for the second quarter of DCS is focused on strategic asset deployment in areas where utilization and productivity are maximized as well as cost control which will continue to play a key role in consistent operating margin improvement This
